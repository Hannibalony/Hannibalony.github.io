				This project required me to draw on my understanding of working with media by building YouTube's video player page and i got to work with positioning elements the hard way too. (the example video is from the band <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Fromindianlakes" target="_blank">'From Indian Lakes'</a>).

				<span class="intro-paragraph">I'm Justine mar, a 19 year old Computer Engineering Student. Besides being at university i also tend to explore more about my field whenever i have the time. Since elementary i've always been curious how things work and when i first got my hand on a computer back in 2006 (i was 9 years old) my learning phase was at rapid because of the technology i posessed. I got interested in programming when i came across a site where you can create your own game by writing Lua code (a programming language, widely used as a scripting language by game developers). The first week of trying it out was just trial and error and asking questions on the site forum, but eventually i got comfortable with it and i was fascinated when i made a command work. I stick with the site for a couple more months until i look up the other things that got me interested like writing programs with VB.net, I also got hooked with Web Application Security where i learned SQL/Bugs and being a skid. But of course i didn't actually did all this for 11 years... i have a life too. I just enjoyed doing those stuff i haven't realized yet how important and how these technology shapes our word i was doing it for fun. It's when i was in High School i started to be more serious about these stuff, i became more active at InfoSec i got free stuff and some cash whenever i find holes to a website that can cause trouble to their visitors (these are just mostly small companies, my highest bounty was $150). Now, I'm in web development trying to be a full stack developer.
